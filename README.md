## Who am I?
My name is David, I'm Andalusian (from the south of the spanish state) and I've been working as a developer since 2007, starting developing Geographic Information Systems based in Java...it's been too long since that. 

## What do I work on?
Now I'm a Software Engineer working with PHP in Drupal-based projects, very focused on the design of architectures and certain Drupal APIs such as Migrate API and its backend in general. In my free time I collaborate with [Open Source Software](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) implementing patches for Drupal or spreading through articles I'm writing in different channels...
